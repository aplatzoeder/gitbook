# Scripts and Event Handlers

Scripts and Event Handlers contain all the logic and code which execute when an [Event](broken-reference) is triggered.

Currently Stadium allows you to hook an event onto Buttons, Data Grids, Images, Links, Radio Button lists, Checkboxes, Date Pickers and Drop-down lists, as well as onto pages for Load events. You can build up a flow of steps to complete what you need to do, like write to a SQL Database, get a file, navigate to a different page, call a webservice, prompt the user to make a decision (message box) and do basic IF/Else programming.

[Here](.gitbook/assets/Actions) is a list of all actions currently available in Stadium.
