### Publish an application for the first time

Steps:

1. Click Publish on the toolbar
2. Add an Application Manager to publish to:
3.
   * Provide a _name_ for your Application Manager
   * Enter the _URL_ that was provided to you when you signed up for a Stadium Server
   * Enter the _email_ and _password_ that you provided when you signed up for Stadium Server
   *   Click Save

       \
       _Note:_\

6.
   * Select your application's Login Mode:
   *
     * _Email & Password_ - Users will log in to your Application with their email adress and password.
     * _None_                       - Users will not be required to log in and will have access to all pages in your Application.
   * \

     &#x20;    (An Admin User is a user that can access an application's administration features, i.e. maintaining user roles and users.)\

   *
     * _When Login Mode is Email & Password_ - Provide Email, Password and a display Name.
     * _When Login Mode is None_                      - No Admin User will be created.
