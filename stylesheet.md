# StyleSheet

A StyleSheet can be added to style or format the way your page and controls will be displayed in a browser.

StyleSheets are based on the Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) standard and format.

Copy and paste the contents of a CSS stylesheet into the StyleSheet Editor, or create your stylesheet from scratch.

_Note:_

* If you also created styles using the [Styles Editor](broken-reference), then for any duplicate 'global' styles this stylesheet will override the styles from the Styles Editor.
* Inline styles created with the Styles Editor (for specific control instances) will always override any other styles.

***

Note:\


* The StyleSheet menu option is only available when the application's Enable Style Sheet property has been selected.
