The Stadium Designer is a Windows desktop application that lets you design and generate professional web applications in minutes.

_Create a basic application_

### Design complete applications

Data-driven web applications have 3 main objectives:

1. Connect to data sources.
2. Present (display) data in a visually appealing and user friendly way.
3. Enable users to perform specific actions on data.

This is how Stadium helps you design _complete_ applications:

1 [Data](.gitbook/assets/designwithstadiumnext1) 2 [Presentation](.gitbook/assets/designwithstadiumnext2) 3 [User interaction](.gitbook/assets/designwithstadiumnext3)

_Create a basic data-driven application_

### Design applications fast

A typical design process:

1 Connect to your data\


\
Add a [connector](.gitbook/assets/Connectors) and queries or functions to retrieve data from a database, web service or file.

2 Design how you want to present your data

\
Add [pages](broken-reference) to your application, then drag-and-drop [controls](.gitbook/assets/Controls) (labels, textboxes, data grids, drop-downs and other form fields) onto your pages.

\
_Create a basic data-driven application (part 2)_

3 Assign the data to your controls

\
Create [event handlers](broken-reference) consisting of scripts, [actions](.gitbook/assets/Actions), [queries](.gitbook/assets/DatabaseConnector) or [functions](.gitbook/assets/WebServiceConnector) that will assign data to your controls when specific [events](broken-reference) are triggered, e.g. when a page loads (event), the event handler could include a SQL query and a SetValue action to assign data to a textbox control.

4 Add functionality for users to interact with your data

\
Create [event handlers](broken-reference) consisting of scripts, [actions](.gitbook/assets/Actions), [queries](.gitbook/assets/DatabaseConnector) or [functions](.gitbook/assets/WebServiceConnector) that will execute when specific [events](broken-reference) are triggered by users, e.g. when a user clicks a button, the event handler could include a SQL query to insert form field values into a database.
