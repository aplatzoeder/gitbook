[**Events**](broken-reference)

***



[**Expression Editor**](broken-reference)

Use the Expression Editor to assist you when complex expressions are required to create the property values of controls and actions.

***



[**Pages**](broken-reference)

Pages are what makes up Stadium applications. Create pages and provide navigation to allow users to browse the site.

***



[**Preview**](broken-reference)

Preview your application to verify correct display and behaviour before you deploy it.

***



[**Publish**](broken-reference)

Applications can be published to your server from within Stadium Designer.

***



[**Scripts / Event Handlers**](broken-reference)

Scripts and Event Handlers can be added to a load, click or change Event to provide specific behaviours.

***



[**Settings**](broken-reference)

Settings are static values that cannot be changed. If you use settings for environment-specific values, such as file paths, it becomes easier to migrate applications between environments.

***



[**Styles**](broken-reference)

Use the Styles Editor to create the styles that determine how your pages and controls will be displayed.

***



[**Style Sheet**](broken-reference)

You can paste the contents of a CSS stylesheet into the StyleSheet editor to style the way your pages and controls will be displayed.

***



[**Templates**](broken-reference)

Templates are used to display specific controls on multiple screens in your application without having to add those controls to each page.

***



[**Types**](broken-reference)

Types can be used to create variables of different types that can be used in your application's processing of data.
